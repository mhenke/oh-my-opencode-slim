# Release Process

This project has two related release tracks:

- **Plugin release**: the npm package version from `package.json`, tagged as
  `v<version>` and published to npm.
- **Companion release**: native desktop binaries, tagged as
  `companion-v<version>` and uploaded as GitHub Release assets.

The companion uses separate versioning so the plugin can ship patches without
rebuilding native binaries every time.

## 1. Inspect the release diff

Before writing release notes, inspect the actual changes between the previous
plugin tag and the new plugin tag or release branch state.

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate v2.0.0..HEAD
git diff --stat v2.0.0..HEAD
git diff --name-only v2.0.0..HEAD
```

Use that diff to write the GitHub release body. Do not rely on memory.

Recommended release note sections:

- Added
- Changed
- Fixed
- Docs
- CI
- Compatibility / migration notes
- Publish notes

## 2. Choose versions

Pick versions independently:

```text
plugin: 2.0.3
plugin tag: v2.0.3

companion: 0.1.3
companion tag: companion-v0.1.3
```

Use a plugin patch release for ordinary bug fixes and release-process fixes.
Only bump the companion when the Rust companion changes or the plugin expects a
new companion state protocol or asset set.

## 3. Update companion references

When releasing a new companion binary, update the packaged companion manifest:

```json
// src/companion/companion-manifest.json
{
  "version": "0.1.3",
  "tag": "companion-v0.1.3",
  "repo": "alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim",
  "checksums": {
    "oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz": "..."
  }
}
```

The installer and updater read the packaged JSON manifest at runtime. Keep the
matching fallback constant in `src/companion/updater.ts` synchronized with the
JSON manifest; tests cover this sync.

Also update the Rust crate version:

```toml
# companion/Cargo.toml
version = "0.1.3"
```

Regenerate or update `companion/Cargo.lock` so the package entry matches.

Update companion documentation in:

- `docs/companion.md`
- `docs/configuration.md`

Supported companion workflow target names:

```text
macos-arm64
macos-x64
linux-x64
linux-arm64
windows-x64
```

Expected release asset names for companion `0.1.3`:

```text
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
oh-my-opencode-slim-companion-v0.1.3-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

## 4. Build and publish companion assets

Trigger the manual workflow from the release-prep ref that contains the
Companion changes. Building from the prep ref lets you publish the native
assets, copy their final digests into the manifest, and only then merge a
self-consistent release change:

```bash
gh workflow run companion-release.yml \
  --ref <release-prep-branch> \
  -f version=0.1.3 \
  -f targets=macos-arm64,macos-x64,linux-x64,linux-arm64,windows-x64
```

Watch the run:

```bash
gh run list --workflow companion-release.yml --limit 5
gh run watch <run-id>
```

Verify the companion release:

```bash
gh release view companion-v0.1.3
```

Download assets for a local sanity check:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/companion-v0.1.3-assets
gh release download companion-v0.1.3 \
  --dir /tmp/companion-v0.1.3-assets
```

Confirm the asset list matches the installer targets before publishing the
plugin package that points to this companion tag.

Copy each asset's SHA256 digest into `src/companion/companion-manifest.json`.
GitHub release asset metadata reports these as `digest: sha256:<hash>`; store
only the hash value in the manifest. Then mirror the same values in the fallback
`COMPANION_MANIFEST` constant in `src/companion/updater.ts`.

Before merging the release prep or publishing the plugin, run:

```bash
bun run verify:companion-manifest
```

The verifier fails if the Rust crate version, manifest version/tag, supported
asset names, SHA256 values, or TypeScript fallback manifest drift apart.
`npm publish` runs the same verification through `prepublishOnly`, so a plugin
release cannot silently ship a stale Companion manifest.

### Manual companion upload fallback

If the workflow builds artifacts successfully but the release upload step fails,
download the workflow artifacts and upload them manually:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> \
  --dir /tmp/companion-v0.1.3-assets

gh release create companion-v0.1.3 \
  --title "Companion v0.1.3" \
  --notes "Manual companion binary release for oh-my-opencode-slim." \
  /tmp/companion-v0.1.3-assets/*
```

If the release already exists, upload with clobber:

```bash
gh release upload companion-v0.1.3 \
  /tmp/companion-v0.1.3-assets/* \
  --clobber
```

Then verify:

```bash
gh release view companion-v0.1.3
```

## 5. Bump the plugin package

For a stable patch, update `package.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.3"
}
```

If you manually edit the version, do **not** later run `bun run release:patch` or
`npm version patch`, because that would bump the package again.

If you have not manually edited the version, use npm's version command instead:

```bash
npm version patch
```

That creates the version commit and annotated `v<version>` tag automatically.
The package's `version` lifecycle hook runs after npm updates `package.json` but
before npm creates the commit and tag. It force-regenerates
`src/generated/build-info.ts` with the new package version and stages it, so the
version commit and tag both point to the commit containing the generated stamp.
The hook does not amend or otherwise rewrite the commit after tagging.

For the automatic patch release chain, `bun run release:patch` runs
`npm version patch`, pushes the current branch and its annotated version tag
with `git push --follow-tags`, then publishes to npm. Review the pending release
changes and ensure the working tree is clean before running it; this command
performs both the push and npm publish. The `release:minor`, `release:major`,
`release:beta`, and `release:beta:next` scripts follow the same sequence with
their respective npm version and publish tags.

If you bumped the version manually, run `bun run gen:build-info` (the version
change triggers the rewrite) and include the generated file in the version
commit. Ordinary `bun run build` runs leave the committed stamp untouched, so
building never dirties the git tree.

## 6. Verify before tagging or publishing

Run the standard checks:

```bash
bun run check:ci
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run build
bun run verify:companion-manifest
```

CI installs the Bun version pinned by `packageManager` in `package.json` and
uses `bun ci` so lockfile drift fails instead of rewriting `bun.lock`. Required
CI uploads JUnit and LCOV reports. A non-blocking latest-Bun canary reports
upcoming runtime incompatibilities, package smoke runs for package-affecting
pull requests, and the scheduled OpenCode compatibility workflow checks both
the pinned supported host and latest host canary.

Before committing or tagging, inspect:

```bash
git status --short
git diff
git log --oneline -10
```

## 7. Commit and push release prep

Stage only intended files. Typical files for a companion-backed plugin patch:

```text
.github/workflows/companion-release.yml
companion/Cargo.toml
companion/Cargo.lock
docs/companion.md
docs/configuration.md
package.json
src/companion/companion-manifest.json
src/companion/updater.ts
```

Commit and push:

```bash
git add <intended-files>
git commit -m "chore: prepare companion 0.1.3 release"
git push
```

## 8. Create and push the plugin tag

If `npm version` created the tag, push it:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

If the package version was edited manually, create and push the tag yourself:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.3 -m "v2.0.3"
git push origin v2.0.3
```

Verify the tag exists remotely:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin v2.0.3
```

## 9. Create the GitHub plugin release

Use release notes based on the actual git diff.

```bash
gh release create v2.0.3 \
  --title "v2.0.3" \
  --notes-file /tmp/oh-my-opencode-slim-v2.0.3-notes.md
```

If a release already exists, update it:

```bash
gh release edit v2.0.3 \
  --title "v2.0.3" \
  --notes-file /tmp/oh-my-opencode-slim-v2.0.3-notes.md
```

Verify:

```bash
gh release view v2.0.3
```

## 10. Publish npm

Publishing is the final step and requires npm authentication:

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

After publishing, verify the package version:

```bash
npm view oh-my-opencode-slim version
```

## 11. Current v2.0.3 release checklist

For the `2.0.3` / `companion-v0.1.3` release, the completed state should be:

- `package.json` version is `2.0.3`.
- `src/companion/companion-manifest.json` points to `companion-v0.1.3`.
- Git tag `v2.0.3` exists on origin.
- GitHub release `v2.0.3` exists.
- GitHub release `companion-v0.1.3` exists with the expected assets.
- Working tree is clean.
- `bun run check:ci`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun run build`, and
  `bun run verify:companion-manifest` pass.
- npm publish is run only after the GitHub release and companion assets are ready.
