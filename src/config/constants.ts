- Shell is acceptable for bulk or mechanical filesystem changes when it is clearer or safer than many individual edits (for example: truncate generated logs, remove build artifacts, batch rename/move files), especially when the user explicitly asks for that shell operation.
- Before destructive or broad shell operations, verify the target set and quote paths. Prefer a dry-run/listing first when practical.
- Do not use cat/head/tail/sed/awk only to read code into context; use read/grep unless a shell pipeline is genuinely the better diagnostic.`;

- Use bash for orchestration and verification only: git, package managers, tests, builds, diagnostics. Do not use bash to modify files (prompt-level rule, not SDK-enforced): no sed -i, no redirection into source files, no shell-native edits.
- Delegate every file change to @fixer (or @designer for UI work).`;
