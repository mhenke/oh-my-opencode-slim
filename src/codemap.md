## Responsibility

Core plugin implementation for **oh-my-opencode-slim**, providing:
- Main plugin initialization and OpenCode integration: a thin `index.ts`
  orchestrator delegating to the `src/bootstrap/` modules (session state,
  profile boot, background jobs, tools)
- Dual v1/v2 host export: `default.server` (v1) + `default.setup` (v2 adapter via `src/v2/`)
- Terminal User Interface (TUI) sidebar plugin for agent status display (`tui.ts`)
- Client-side multiplexer pane lifecycle, wired only from the TUI entry (`src/multiplexer/client/`)
- TUI state persistence and synchronization across sessions (`tui-state.ts`)
- Three-level TUI `/preset` manager (`tui-preset.ts`)
- Emergency kill-all for running subagents (`tui-kill.ts`)
- Installer-managed plugin-entry marker (`plugin-entry.ts`)
- Plugin init health-check thresholds and helpers (`health-check.ts`)

This directory serves as the primary entry point for the plugin's runtime behavior, configuration system, and user-facing UI components.

## Design

### Architectural Patterns

- **Plugin Pattern**: The plugin follows OpenCode's plugin architecture with a single exported plugin function that returns agent, tool, and MCP registrations
- **Facade Pattern**: `index.ts` acts as a facade that composes multiple subsystems (agents, tools, MCPs, hooks)
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven architecture using OpenCode's event system for session lifecycle, message updates, and tool execution
- **Strategy Pattern**: Runtime model selection and fallback via `ForegroundFallbackManager`
- **Client-local pane lifecycle**: `src/multiplexer/client/` runs only in the TUI entry's dependency graph (per-client pane map, in-process uniqueness, stable-idle close); the server entry never reaches it (invariant I1, enforced by `dependency-contract.test.ts`)
- **Admission runtime lease**: `admission-runtime.ts` scopes the background
  scheduler and pending-call tracker per directory, retaining them across
  immediate plugin-generation replacement and disposing them after the last
  owner is gone.

### Data Flow

```
OpenCode Core → Plugin Initialization (index.ts)
  → Agent Registration (createAgents/getAgentConfigs)
  → Tool Registration (createCancelTaskTool, etc.)
  → MCP Registration (createBuiltinMcps)
  → Hook Registration (auto-update, phase reminders, cache monitor, etc.)
  → Event Subscription (session lifecycle, message updates, tool execution)
  → Runtime State Tracking (tui-state.ts)
  → TUI Rendering (tui.ts → sidebar_content slot)
  → TUI Client Pane Lifecycle (multiplexer/client/tui-wiring.ts)
  → TUI /preset Management (tui-preset.ts → preset-switch.ts)
```

### Key Components

| File | Role | Dependencies |
|------|------|--------------|
| `index.ts` | Thin plugin entry: delegates bootstrap to `src/bootstrap/` and orchestrates the remaining server-side subsystems; exports dual `server`/`setup` default | bootstrap modules, hooks, commands, v2 adapter |
| `bootstrap/` | Bootstrap modules extracted from `index.ts`: session-state, profile boot + v2 profile refresh, background jobs, tools | config/, agents/, hooks/, utils/, tools/, mcp/ |
| `admission-runtime.ts` | Per-directory scheduler/pending-call runtime lease | Background task concurrency, task-session pending calls |
| `tui.ts` | TUI sidebar plugin for agent model display; wires the client-side multiplexer pane lifecycle | tui-state.ts, config constants, multiplexer/client |
| `tui-state.ts` | Persistent state management for TUI | Node.js fs/promises, os module |
| `tui-preset.ts` | Three-level `/preset` manager (preset list → agents → agent edit) using `api.ui` dialogs | preset-switch.ts, config loader/constants |
| `plugin-entry.ts` | Installer-managed plugin entry marker and `PluginEntry` type | none |
| `health-check.ts` | Init health-check thresholds and disabled-tool-aware minimum tool count | none (kept internal, not re-exported) |

## Flow

### Plugin Initialization Flow (index.ts)

The entry point is a thin orchestrator: it creates `createSessionState(ctx)`
(with lazy `bind()` accessors) before the init try-block, then calls the
`src/bootstrap/` factories in order — `bootProfile` → `createBackgroundJobs`
→ `createTools` — with the remaining hooks/commands wired between. See
`src/bootstrap/codemap.md` for the module details.

1. **Session State** (`bootstrap/session-state.ts`): `createSessionState()`
   builds session metadata, TUI activity tracking, and model-selection
   resolvers; `bind()` wires lazy accessors to the runtime, fallback
   manager, job board, and final host agent config
2. **Profile Boot** (`bootstrap/profile.ts`): `bootProfile()` calls
   `loadPluginConfig()` and seeds the `RuntimeConfig` singleton (host
   config captured); the persisted runtime preset is reapplied
3. **Agent Creation** (`bootProfile`): `createAgents()` instantiates agent
   definitions (incl. dynamic councillors) with prompts and permissions;
   `getAgentConfigsFromDefinitions()` merges defaults with user overrides
   and runtime presets
4. **Background Job Machinery** (`bootstrap/background-jobs.ts`):
   `createBackgroundJobs()` builds the job board, coordinator, terminal
   gate, supervisor, revived-run tracker, foreground fallback manager,
   task-session manager hook, and orchestrator-wake scheduler
5. **Hook/Command Initialization**: Auto-update checker, chat headers,
   phase reminders, council inject, apply-patch, guards/recovery, deepwork/
   reflect/loop commands, interview manager, companion manager
6. **Tool + MCP Registration** (`bootstrap/tools.ts`): `createTools()`
   assembles the task tool family, wait_for_user, ACP, webfetch, AST-grep,
   and built-in MCPs (context7, gh_grep), applying the disabled-tools
   filter
7. **Runtime Model Resolution**: Resolves model arrays to startup primaries; v1 `task` and `task_revive` share prompt-claimed live fallback intentions, `task_message` pins transcript execution selection excluding compaction summaries, and v2 uses per-call `model#variant` overrides; internal v1 completions still follow the continuation policy
8. **TUI State Sync**: `recordTuiAgentModels()` captures resolved models/variants for TUI display
9. **Health Check**: Validates agent/tool/MCP counts against `HEALTH_CHECK` thresholds, adjusted for disabled baseline tools via `minimumExpectedToolCount`
10. **Companion Management**: Ensures companion version compatibility

The server entry does not initialize any multiplexer/pane subsystem: pane
lifecycle lives in the TUI entry's dependency graph (`multiplexer/client/`).

### TUI Rendering Flow (tui.ts)

1. **Plugin Registration**: TUI plugin registered with OpenCode's TUI system via `tui` export
2. **Version Detection**: Reads plugin version from package.json or uses 'dev'
3. **Config Validation**: Checks if current directory has valid plugin config
4. **Snapshot Loading**: Reads agent models, variants, and per-session activity
   from `tui-state.ts`
5. **Live Updates**: Refreshes persisted state every 1000ms and reactively
   advances 100ms animation frames only while agents are active
6. **Pane Lifecycle Wiring**: `createTuiPaneWiring()` resolves admission from
   the client's own environment, initializes plugin logging, reflects the
   server URL, subscribes to session events, and drives per-client pane
   create/close/rebuild plus the periodic reconcile sweep
7. **Sidebar Rendering**: Renders sidebar with:
   - Plugin header (OMO-Slim + version)
   - Config status warning (if invalid)
   - Agent list with resolved model names and Braille activity indicators
8. **Lifecycle Management**: Cleans up refresh/animation timers, unsubscribes
   pane events, stops timers, and best-effort closes this client's panes on
   dispose

### State Persistence Flow (tui-state.ts)

1. **State Path Resolution**: Determines XDG-compliant state directory (`~/.local/share/opencode/storage/oh-my-opencode-slim/tui-state.json`)
2. **Snapshot Operations**:
   - `readTuiSnapshot()`: Reads and parses state file (returns empty snapshot on error)
   - `readTuiSnapshotAsync()`: Async variant for TUI rendering
   - `recordTuiAgentModels()`: Updates both agent models and variants atomically
   - `recordTuiAgentModel()`: Updates single agent's model/variant
   - `recordTuiAgentActivity()`: Tracks active agents by session so concurrent
     runs of the same agent remain visible until all runs finish
   - `clearTuiAgentActivities()`: Removes stale activity during startup
3. **Atomic Writes**: Cross-process file locking serializes each read → mutate →
   atomic rename transaction, with dead-owner and aged-lock recovery
4. **Error Handling**: All operations are best-effort; failures don't crash plugin
5. **Instance Cleanup**: On shutdown, each plugin instance removes only sessions
   it marked active, preserving activity owned by other running instances
6. **Instance Scope**: opencode loads the plugin once per location inside one
   server process and broadcasts every event to every instance. Both the v1
   event hook and the v2 setup event pump process only events whose directory
   resolves to this instance's location (fail-open when the directory is
   unresolved or no live instance owns it), so per-instance state never
   absorbs another location's sessions. Every exit path of an instance —
   normal dispose, v1 init failure, v2 factory failure — releases its
   live-directory claim, and the process-global wake gate is cleared only
   when the last instance is gone

### Event Handling Flow (index.ts)

Key event flows:

1. **Session Lifecycle**:
   - `session.created` → register child session
   - `session.status` → Companion updates and TUI activity state (pane
     lifecycle is handled separately by the TUI client wiring)
   - `session.deleted` → cleanup session agent map, Companion state, and TUI
     activity state

2. **Message Updates**:
   - `message.updated` → record agent/model usage in TUI state

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - `tool.execute.before` → apply patch and task session hooks
   - `tool.execute.after` → post-tool hooks (retry guidance, JSON error recovery)

4. **Chat Integration**:
   - `chat.message` → track session → agent/model mapping, preserve live v1 fallback selection across native background completions, and mark TUI activity
   - `experimental.chat.system.transform` → inject orchestrator prompt for serve mode
   - `experimental.chat.messages.transform` → phase reminders, skill filtering, image attachment processing

5. **Command Execution**:
   - `command.execute.before` → interview, deepwork, reflect, and loop command hooks (preset switching moved to the TUI)

6. **Cache Telemetry**:
   - `message.updated` (completed assistant requests) → cache monitor observes `tokens.cache.read/write` and logs prompt-cache bust/plateau warnings

## Integration

### Consumers

- **OpenCode Core**: Main plugin entry point consumed by OpenCode's plugin system
- **TUI System**: `tui.ts` slot registration consumed by OpenCode's TUI renderer
- **Agents**: Agent configurations consumed by OpenCode's agent registry
- **Tools**: Tool definitions consumed by OpenCode's tool system
- **MCPs**: MCP definitions consumed by OpenCode's MCP registry

### Dependencies

- **Config System** (`src/config/`): Configuration loading, validation, the `RuntimeConfig` runtime-state singleton, and runtime presets
- **Agents** (`src/agents/`): Agent personalities and permission sets
- **Tools** (`src/tools/`): Tool implementations (task lifecycle controls, webfetch, AST operations, ACP)
- **Hooks** (`src/hooks/`): Lifecycle hooks for auto-update, phase reminders, cache monitor, orchestrator wake, etc.
- **Multiplexer** (`src/multiplexer/`): Client-side pane lifecycle (`client/`) plus tmux/Zellij/Herdr/cmux/kitty adapters; wired only from the TUI entry
- **Council** (`src/agents/council.ts`, `src/agents/council-agents.ts`): Multi-LLM council orchestration
- **Companion** (`src/companion/`): Companion version management
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`): Logger, environment checks, background job board/supervisor, session status
- **V2 Adapter** (`src/v2/`): Wraps the v1 factory for the v2 host via `default.setup`

### Cross-Directory Flow

1. **Plugin Initialization**: `src/index.ts` imports and composes the server-side subsystems; the TUI entry composes its own sidebar and pane-lifecycle wiring
2. **State Synchronization**: TUI state in `src/tui-state.ts` is updated during plugin init and message events
3. **UI Integration**: TUI plugin in `src/tui.ts` reads state and renders sidebar
4. **Event Propagation**: Events flow from OpenCode → plugin handlers → subsystems → state updates

### Configuration Integration

- Plugin config loaded via `loadPluginConfig()` with support for:
  - User overrides from `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`
  - Preset switching via the TUI `/preset` manager (persisted to the config file; v2 hosts request the live inference-profile refresh for NEW child sessions and the sidebar — existing sessions stay frozen — and a malformed config keeps the last-known-good state; v1 hosts apply on next reload)
  - Environment-based disablement via `OH_MY_OPENCODE_SLIM_DISABLE`
- Agent configurations merged with user settings from OpenCode config
- Model resolution supports both string models and array-based fallback chains

### Error Handling & Resilience

- **Config Errors**: Non-fatal; plugin continues with defaults and logs warnings
- **State Errors**: Non-fatal; TUI falls back to empty state
- **Event Errors**: Wrapped in try/catch; plugin continues operation
- **Dependency Failures**: Health checks detect missing dependencies (e.g., jsdom for webfetch)

## Testing & Validation

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode ensures type correctness
- **Health Checks**: Validates minimum agent/tool/MCP registrations on init
- **Config Validation**: Schema-based validation via Zod in config system
- **TUI State**: Best-effort persistence; failures don't affect core functionality

## Performance Considerations

- **Live Updates**: TUI reads state every 1000ms and animates active Braille
  indicators every 100ms without extra disk reads
- **Atomic State**: State writes are atomic to prevent corruption
- **Lazy Initialization**: Some subsystems (e.g., webfetch probe) run async without blocking init
- **Event-Driven**: Minimal polling; relies on OpenCode's event system

## Future Extensions

- **Dynamic Agent Registration**: Support runtime agent addition/removal
- **State Migration**: Versioned state format for breaking changes
- **TUI Customization**: Allow user-defined sidebar layouts
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and display plugin performance in TUI
