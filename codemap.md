# Repository Atlas: oh-my-opencode-slim

## Project Responsibility

`oh-my-opencode-slim` is an OpenCode plugin that implements a specialist-agent operating model on top of the host runtime. Its core responsibilities include:

- Defining orchestrator and specialist agent factories with permission policies
- Loading layered plugin configuration and per-agent permissions
- Exposing additional tools and MCP integrations
- Managing background job-board orchestration and terminal multiplexer visualization
- Injecting workflow-enforcement hooks plus runtime command handlers
- Shipping install-time skills and a bootstrap CLI

This codemap covers the plugin repository itself and excludes the nested `opencode/` upstream checkout.

## System Entry Points

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | Package manifest, dependency graph, release scripts, published file list. |
| `src/index.ts` | Thin plugin orchestrator: creates session state, delegates bootstrap to `src/bootstrap/` (profiles → background jobs → tools), then wires hooks, commands, interview support, the cache monitor, and health checks. Does not touch multiplexer pane lifecycle (client-only). Exports the dual `default.server`/`default.setup` so v1 and v2 hosts share one build. |
| `src/cli/index.ts` | CLI entrypoint for installation/bootstrap workflows. |
| `src/config/schema.ts` | Source-of-truth runtime config schema used by validation and schema generation. |
| `src/config/runtime.ts` | Per-directory `RuntimeConfig` singleton: derived getters over the frozen plugin config, pre-mutation host-config snapshot, and preset/model overrides. |
| `scripts/generate-schema.ts` | Generates `oh-my-opencode-slim.schema.json` from the Zod config schema. |

## Runtime Control Flow

1. **Plugin startup**
   - OpenCode loads `src/index.ts` (v1 via `default.server`; v2 via `default.setup` through `src/v2/`).
   - Config is loaded and normalized through `src/config/`; the `RuntimeConfig` singleton captures the pre-mutation host config.
   - Agent definitions (incl. dynamic councillors) are produced by `src/agents/`.
   - Tool factories from `src/tools/` and MCP definitions from `src/mcp/` are registered.
   - Hooks from `src/hooks/` are attached; the observation-only cache monitor is created before config loads and sees every event.
   - Delegation orchestration, interview support, task-session aliasing, orchestrator-wake scheduling, TUI preset switching, and the init health check are initialized. (Multiplexer pane lifecycle is initialized by the TUI client in `src/tui.ts`, never by the server entry.)

2. **Interactive request handling**
   - The orchestrator prompt drives routing decisions.
   - Tool calls resolve through `src/tools/` or built-in OpenCode tools.
   - Hooks can transform prompts/messages, normalize system message arrays, repair tool failures, or intercept runtime commands before/after execution.
   - Prompt content is injected only through the cache-safe helpers in `src/hooks/cache-safe-injection.ts` so provider prompt-cache prefixes stay byte-stable.

3. **Delegated execution**
   - Native OpenCode background tasks are parsed from `task` output and tracked in the shared background job board (board + store + coordinator + supervisor in `src/utils/`).
   - `src/hooks/task-session-manager/` updates job-board state, resolves short aliases, and injects background/reusable job context; runtime-status reconciliation and the shared terminal-publication gate (`background-job-terminal-gate.ts`) keep board state honest against live session status.
   - `src/hooks/orchestrator-wake/` periodically nudges an idle parent orchestrator when incomplete TODOs remain and reacts to jobs that stop without a terminal result.
   - The TUI client (`src/tui.ts` → `src/multiplexer/client/`) optionally mirrors those sessions into tmux, Zellij, Herdr, cmux, or kitty panes/surfaces; each client anchors new panes to its own pane resolved from the client environment at spawn time (never a shared registry).
   - Results flow back into the parent session through notifications/output polling.

4. **Install/release path**
   - `src/cli/` configures host OpenCode instances.
   - `src/skills/` is copied into the user skill directory.
   - `scripts/` validates generated schema, package completeness, and host-load behavior.

## Key Cross-Module Integration Points

- `src/index.ts` is the central composition root for nearly every runtime subsystem.
- `src/config/` feeds `src/agents/`, session/delegation utilities, and MCP registration.
- `src/cli/skills.ts` and `src/cli/custom-skills.ts` bridge install-time skill packaging with runtime permission policy.
- `src/multiplexer/` is client-only: `src/tui.ts` wires the per-client pane lifecycle, while the server entry must not reach `src/multiplexer/client/*` or the adapters (enforced by `src/dependency-contract.test.ts`, invariant I1).
- `src/multiplexer/cmux/` is a plain adapter: readiness polling, retry/mutation queues, orphan cooldowns, close budgets, and global pane registries no longer exist in the module.
- Council mode is implemented in `src/agents/`; `council-agents.ts` builds dynamic `councillor-<name>` subagents from council presets, the orchestrator dispatches them, and the council agent synthesizes responses.
- `src/tools/preset-switch.ts` + `src/tui-preset.ts` + `src/preset-editor-domain.ts` implement `/preset` switching: the preset name (or preset edits) is persisted to the user config file. Agent definitions are never hot-swapped mid-session; on v2 hosts the write requests the live refresh and only the inference fields (`model`, `variant`, `temperature`, `options`) apply to NEW child sessions (frozen for each child before its first request via the awaited `session.prompt` hook) plus the sidebar, while prompts/tools/permissions/skills/MCPs stay frozen for existing sessions; a malformed config is rejected before any swap (last-known-good state kept). v1 hosts apply on the next reload. The `preset-editor-domain` module holds the pure domain helpers (name validation, sentinel-safe choices, descriptions, inheritance, immutable edits, parsing) shared by the v1 JSX editor and the v2 promise-dialog editor.
- `src/hooks/task-session-manager/` depends on `src/utils/background-job-board.ts`, `background-job-store.ts`, `background-job-coordinator.ts`, `background-job-supervisor.ts`, `session-runtime-status.ts`, and `task.ts`, and injects prompt content only through `src/hooks/cache-safe-injection.ts`.
- `src/hooks/cache-monitor/` watches `message.updated` cache telemetry across all sessions and logs prompt-cache-bust/plateau warnings; it is observation-only and never mutates messages.
- `src/hooks/orchestrator-wake/` reads host todo/children/status APIs (v1)
  or `session.list({parentID})` + event tracking (v2 degraded mode), gates on
  the task-session-manager's `hasInputWait` and continuation-model seams, and
  shares one-flight/no-progress state via a process-global wake gate.
- `src/v2/` wraps the v1 factory for the v2 host: `setup(ctx)` shims a v1 `PluginInput`, runs the v1 `config()` hook, and adapts agent/tool/command/hook registrations into v2 domains.
- Skill permissions are projected into agent/session configuration; native v1/v2 hosts discover and filter skills from those finalized permissions, denying hidden skills and asking for discoverable ones. The plugin does not rewrite `<available_skills>` in conversation text.
- `src/interview/` hooks into plugin command/event surfaces exposed by `src/index.ts`.

## Root Assets

- `README.md`: user-facing product overview, install docs, and agent descriptions.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent operating conventions for this repository.
- `biome.json`: formatting/lint policy.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler settings.
- `.slim/codemap.json`: codemap change-detection state for this repository.
- `scripts/verify-release-artifact.ts`: release artifact validation script.
- `src/health-check.ts`: plugin init health-check thresholds (`HEALTH_CHECK`) and `minimumExpectedToolCount` (accounts for disabled baseline tools); kept internal — never re-exported from the package root — so the legacy plugin loader cannot mis-invoke helpers as plugin factories (issue #894).
- `src/plugin-entry.ts`: `INSTALLER_MANAGED_PLUGIN_OPTION` marker and `PluginEntry` type for installer-managed config entries.
- `src/tui-preset.ts`: three-level TUI `/preset` manager (preset list → agents → agent edit) using `api.ui` dialogs, persisting via `src/tools/preset-switch.ts`. The pure domain logic (name validation, wrapping, descriptions, inheritance, immutable edits, temperature/options parsing) is shared with the v2 editor through `src/preset-editor-domain.ts`; `src/v2/preset-manager.ts` is the promise-dialog counterpart.
- `src/preset-editor-domain.ts`: pure, host-agnostic preset-editor domain helpers shared by the v1 JSX editor and the v2 promise-dialog editor.
